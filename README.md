## 📦 Alerzoshop Demand Forecasting Pipeline

A time-series demand forecasting pipeline using Python, Pandas, and TensorFlow to predict inventory needs for Alerzoshop. The model is built using LSTM and trained on historical sales data to make future demand predictions.

### 🚀 Features
- Cleans and preprocesses sales data
- Transforms time-series into supervised learning sequences
- Builds and trains an LSTM-based forecasting model
- Saves the trained model and scaler for deployment

### 📂 Project Structure
```
.
├── forecast_pipeline.py         # Main pipeline script
├── sales_data.csv               # Your historical sales dataset (user-supplied)
├── model/
│   ├── lstm_model/              # Saved Keras model
│   └── scaler.npy               # Saved scaler for inverse transforms

### 🛠️ Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alerzoshop-forecasting-pipeline.git
$ cd alerzoshop-forecasting-pipeline

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📈 Running the Pipeline
Ensure `sales_data.csv` is in the same folder, with at least two columns: `date` and `sales`.
```bash
$ python forecast_pipeline.py
```

Trained model and scaler will be saved in the `model/` directory.

### 🧠 Future Enhancements
- Streamlit dashboard for visualization
- Model evaluation metrics
- Scheduled retraining with new data
- REST API for forecast queries
